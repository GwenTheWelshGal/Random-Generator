# Random-Generator

This is a random generator written in Python and possessing a simplistic HTML frontend. I'm basing this off a small project I did and committed to GitHub less than a fortnight ago on the account I use for more work-related purposes.

The idea is that inputs can be entered into boxes with a dropdown menu between them or below them that provides context to it. There'll be two buttons **START** and **CLEAR**, and below them is a third box showing the output.

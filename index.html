        <h1 align="center">Random Generator</h1>
        <p align="center">Welcome. On this page, you will find a simplistic random generator that I have coded in Python. I trust that you will find it useful.</p>
        <p align="center">To use it, enter a list of items with each list separated by a semicolon - <b>;</b> - in the boxes on the left and the right, and then click the <em>Start</em> button. Make sure that both lists have the same number of items, or it will not work.</p>
        <p align="center">Below, a list of outputs will be displayed.</p>
        <!--
            Right now, I'm visualizing a couple of boxes in which inputs can be entered, with each item separated either by a semicolon or either being on a new line.
            The START button will randomize the list by shuffling both lists behind the scenes and popping said selection from the list.
            The CLEAR button will do exactly what it says on the tin.
            Below them will be the output showing what was selected.

            Perhaps there should be a dropdown asking what kind of context the user is after, which will affect the output.

            I don't know how in the intergalactic fuck it's going to work yet, but I'm trying to visualise what it'd look like.
            I am not creating a picture version of what I am visualising since I am worse at art than a snail is at yodelling.
